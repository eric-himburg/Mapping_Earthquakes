# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  To complete this project, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website was used to retrieve the geographical coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes.  Subsequently, this data was then added to a map for viewing.  The method for completing this task was done using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then the Leaflet library was employed to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and also used to create interactivity for the earthquake data.
